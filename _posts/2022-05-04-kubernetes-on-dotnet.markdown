May the forth be with you! 

I gave a presentation about using .NET on Kubernetes twice in successive days last week in April. One for the AWS .NET Enterprise Developer Day EMEA 2022 and during the weekly vBrownBag talk hosted by Chris Williams ([@mistwire][mistwire]).

This was an overall fun presentation to give you as there's so many things we have to take in account when deploying your dotnet apps. Given that dotnet was initially developed for Windows platforms, it has evolved into a platform-independent eco-system. You can use Visual Studio on Windows, Linux, or Macs and still gain the same benefits. It's amazing given maybe detractors considered it sisyphean but it was done and in a very admirable way. That goes for PowerShell too!

One note: the vBrownBag talk didn't have me on the recorded video because as an sign langauge user, I always mute myself thus the sign language interpreter can do the voice over clearly thus Zoom, apparently in their brilliance, excluded me from the recording. You can see the interpreter, Amelia, voicing, but that's actually me doing the presentation. Since then, I've fixed the Zoom settings to ensure that I get recorded next time.

The EMEA recording is forthcoming -- similar format, sign langauge intepreters used. You should be able to see me in my glory there.
